# VLSITools
# Open Source VLSI Tools
Open Source tools are emerging for the further development of VLSI research. In this blog, I have listed some of the tools which I have come across in my research life. It is also to be noted the recent OpenRoad project is also trying to create the whole RTL to GDS flow opensourced. You can check their website (https://theopenroadproject.org/). These tools are very helpful in pursuing VLSI-related research. Please find the tools list below,

Mixed-signal Circuit Layout: MAGIC (http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/)

Circuit simulator: ngSPICE  (http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html)

Static Timing Analysis: OpenTimer (https://github.com/thesukantadey/OpenTimer)

Global Router: TritonRoute (https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute)

Physical Flow Integration: Yosys (https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/yosys) 

Deep learning toolkit-enabled VLSI placement: DREAMPlace (https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace)

There are other tools that I will be uploading. If you are aware of other tools that are not mentioned here, please comment below. In the future, I will try to segregate the tools classwise, like RTL tools, Physical Design tools.
